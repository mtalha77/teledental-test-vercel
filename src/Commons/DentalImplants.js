          With the advent of dental implants less than 50 years ago, dentistry
          has provided a great option for people with one or more missing teeth.
          Modern dental implants have improved greatly since its inception
          several decades ago. With many years of dental research, now dentists
          can provide a much better dental restoration option to patients.
          Though with all this technological advancement, still dental implants

          Teledentistry Dental Implant Question - What is a Dental Implant?
        </h3>
        <p>
          A Dental Implant is an artificial Titanium or other material root
          shape metal that is implanted into the jawbone to replace a missing
          tooth root. Then a dental implant crown is attached to the implant
          that is custom-made to fit the person’s mouth and match the color of
          their teeth. People are seeking local teledental dental implant
          consulting services to get more dental implant information, treatment

        <h3>Dental Implant Advantages Blogging:</h3>
        <p>
          Dental Implants have several advantages over dentures. Dental Implants
          are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>More natural and comfortable</li>
          <li>No need to be take it out and clean it every night</li>
          <li>Improves speech</li>
          <li>More durable</li>
          <li>Improves oral health</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, Dental Implants are not suitable for everyone. A person must
          have healthy bones so that the implant can bond to the jawbone.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Local Teledentist Dental Implant Questions - What are the Types of
          Dental Implants:
        </h3>
        <p>Two main types:</p>
        <ul style={{ listStyle: "decimal" }}>
          <li>Endosteal</li>
          <p>
            Endosteal implants are the most common Titanium type of dental
            implants that are placed in the jawbone. They are shaped like small
            screws and suitable for most patients but require a good healthy
            jawbone. Once it is placed in the jawbone, it takes a little time to
            fuse together and form a stronghold. Once it is healed, the
            artificial teeth or the crown can be placed onto it to fit in with
            the surrounding teeth.
          </p>
          <li>Subperiosteal</li>
          <p>
            These dental implants are placed on top of the bone but still under
            the gums. It may be used in patients who do not have enough healthy
            natural jawbone and do not want to undergo intensive oral surgery to
            add bone to the area. In this treatment, a metal frame is placed
            under the gum with an attached post. The gum then heals around the
            frame and holds it in place. The false teeth are then secured to the
            poles that come from the gums.
          </p>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          Teledentist Dental Implant Procedure Chat - How are Dental Implants
          done?
        </h3>
        <p>It usually takes place in three stages:</p>
        <ul style={{ listStyle: "decimal" }}>
          <li>
            During the first stage of surgery, your dentist will put a dental
            implant in the jawbone under the gum tissue. A small sized opening
            is drilled into the bone where the metal implant post will be
            placed, and it is implanted deep into the bone. The gum tissue is
            then brought back to its place by stitching. Biologically, the
            implant and the bone bond together within two to six months. During
            this time, a temporary tooth replacement option can be worn over the
            dental implant site.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the second stage, once the tissue is healed, the dentist will
            attach an abutment to the implant. This is the place where the crown
            will eventually attach. After about two weeks, a dental implant
            impression can be taken, and the dentist can start making the new
            teeth.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the third stage, an artificial replacement tooth is made, and the
            dentist attaches it to the abutment. Unfortunately, this step may
            take several appointments to properly fit the artificial tooth. The
            artificial tooth can either be removable or fixed type or a
            combination of both.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Removable</strong>: It is like conventional removable denture
          and is mounted on a metal frame that is attached to the implant
          abutment and snaps into place. It can be easily removed for daily
          cleaning or repair.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fixed</strong>: In this type, the artificially made crown is
          cemented or screwed permanently onto an implant abutment. You cannot
          remove the crown for cleaning or while sleeping
        </p>
        <h3>
          Right After Tooth Extraction Dental Implant Teledental Info -
          Immediate Dental Implants:
        </h3>
        <p>
          Also called same day implants, these allow placement of temporary
          tooth during the same appointment as the dental implant placement.
          This might be an option for people who have enough bone to support the
          implant and the temporary tooth. This concept is gaining popularity
          especially when front teeth are missing.
          <br />
          In this procedure, the damaged tooth is carefully removed to minimize
          damage to the surrounding bone. The area is then thoroughly cleaned,
          and the implant is placed in that area in the same appointment. Once
          the implant is stable, a temporary crown is fabricated and placed. The
          patient is then instructed to follow a soft diet until a permanent
          restoration is placed.
        </p>
        <h3>What are the advantages of Immediate dental implants?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Restoration is immediate and the patient leaves with a full set of
            teeth. This is important especially in the front areas of the mouth.
          </li>
          <li>Implant fuses to the bone better.</li>
          <li>Gums heal more quickly.</li>
          <li>
            Healing is quicker as it keeps contaminants away from the extraction
            socket.
          </li>
          <li>High success rate of the procedure.</li>
        </ul>

          Dental Implants Teledentistry Hygiene Discussion - How to take care of
          Your Dental Implants?
        </h3>
        <ul style={{ listStyle: "decimal" }}>
          <li>
            <strong>Clean and brush your dental implant</strong>
          </li>
          <p>
            Cleaning the implant at or below the gum line at least twice a day
            with a soft bristle toothbrush is recommended. Soft bristles are
            gentle on the gums and you will be able to clean better with
            delicate and flexible bristles. Avoid toothbrushes with hard
            bristles. Doing virtual teledental dental implant hygiene or
            discussions can be done from time to time. Now, some local dentists
            and local periodontists are using teledental dental implant
            consulting to provide this information.
          </p>
          <li>
            <strong>Floss around the implant</strong>
          </li>
          <p>
            A special floss that goes under the components for thorough cleaning
            can be used. How to floss a dental implant? • Loop the floss around
            the circumference of your implant post • The floss should stick out
            from both sides of the crown • Crisscross the floss in the front of
            the crown and move it back and forth Water flosser can also be used
            that shoots jets of water to remove food residue off gum pockets. It
            comes with narrow tip attachments that can get into corners and hard
            to reach areas.
          </p>
          <li>
            <strong>Use a nylon coated interdental brush</strong>
          </li>
          <p>
            Interdental brushes work well to clean tight and hard to reach
            areas.
          </p>
          <li>
            <strong>Use non-abrasive toothpaste</strong>
          </li>
          <p>
            Toothpaste ingredients that remove stains can wear out materials
            like porcelain and acrylic that make up the false teeth. Hence, a
            non-abrasive toothpaste for false teeth is recommended.
          </p>
          <li>
            <strong>See your dentist regularly</strong>
          </li>
          <p>
            Schedule regular check-ups to maintain the health and proper
            functioning of the implants. Follow the advice of the dentist for
            regular professional cleanings.
          </p>
          <li>
            <strong>Avoid damaging habits</strong>
          </li>
          <p>
            Eating hard or sticky foods can damage your implants such as ice and
            hard candy. It is also a good idea to stop smoking to prevent teeth
            staining.
          </p>
          <li>
            <strong>Getting other treatments</strong>
          </li>
          <p>
            Get night guards if you have a habit of teeth grinding which can
            prevent fracture of teeth and crowns.
          </p>
          <p>
            In summary, dental implants can be a good way of replacing a missing
            tooth or several teeth. It is good to understand how the dental
            implant works and to understand the dental implant hygiene after the
            dental implant placement. Using local teledentistry dental implant
            consultation is a good way of getting some good dental implant
            information and discussing your particular dental situation with
            your dentist. Dental implants if not well cared for, can fail and
            need to be replaced.
