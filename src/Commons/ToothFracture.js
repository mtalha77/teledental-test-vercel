          due to a variety of accidents. In this Teledental Virtual Urdent
          Dentistry Question Answering Blog - we will be discussing fracturing a
          tooth. As we will discuss in the local emergency teledental blog -
          some people experience a dental emergency of breaking or fracturing a
          tooth. This usually happens more frequently for teens and young adults
          who play sports or are very active. It is important to go to your
          local dentist as soon as can to get the necessary dental treatment
          that would be best for hopefully trying to save the tooth. As we will
          explain, sometimes a badly fractured tooth may need to be extracted
          and perhaps a dental implant placed - if there is a large vertical
          fracture down the tooth rooth for instance.

          Tooth fractures can range from minor chips or cracks to more severe
          breaks that can cause pain, sensitivity, and affect the function of
          the tooth. Treatment for a fractured tooth will depend on the extent
          of the damage and can range from a simple filling or bonding to more
          complex treatments such as root canal therapy, dental crowns or even
          tooth extraction. It's important to seek the advice of a dental
          professional if you suspect that you have a fractured tooth.

            For a small or minor tooth fracture, your dentist may use dental
            composite bonding or a filling to repair thetooth fracture or chip.
            Composite bonding or filling materials can help restore the tooth
            chip and have the appearance match somewhat closely the color of the
            tooth. For a single front tooth, a composite filling can fix a small
            chip or small fracture usually. If the tooth has pain and has
            exposed nerve, then may require RCT - root canal therapy. What is
            RCT? If the fracture extends into the tooth pulp nerve tissue, RCT /
            root canal treatment may be necessary

              During a root canal treatment, a pulpotomy is done - by removing
              damaged nerve pulp area. The debridement of the pulp tissue and
              then a special root canal filling is placed. The root canal part
              of the tooth is filled and sealed with usually gutta percha. Gutta
              percha is usually a pink colored rubbery material that goes into
              the root canal area to fill it

              A small composite filling may not suffice. For highly fractured

            A dental crown may be necessary to protect and strengthen the
            fractured tooth after root canal treatment. There are different
            types of dental crowns. Sometimes for smaller dental tooth

            or be enough.

              dental crown may be recommended if a significant portion of the
              tooth is fractured and if the tooth has had root canal treatment.
              If RCT has been done, then the tooth is filled with a core filling
              after root canal treatment or possibly a post & core, and then a
              dental crown impression is done. The dental crown is usually made
              by a dental lab and then cemented onto the tooth. Some dental
              practices, do in-office dental crown lab work. So, can get dental
              crowns placed in on the same day. .

          Severe Tooth Fracture Emergency and Virtual Tooth Extraction Question
          Information
        </h3>
        <p>
          Tooth extraction may need to be done after your dentist does a
          thorough dental exam and has taken dental -xrays.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tooth extraction may be necessary. Sometimes, a badly fractured tooth
          may need to be extracted. A severely fractured tooth may need to
          betaken out and perhaps replaced with a dental implant if it is not
          savable. Tooth extraction treatment may be recommended if the tooth
          cannot be saved. If your tooth poses a risk to the surrounding teeth
          or gums, then your dentist may recommend to extract that tooth
        </p>
        <p>
          The sooner can visit your local dentist for treatment - the better the
          potential outcome. It is vital and important to see your local
          dentist, as soon as possible. A untreated tooth fracture can become
          worse over time. By chewing on a fractured tooth, it may continue to
          fracture and break off possibly.
        </p>
        <p>
          By visiting your local dentist, they can potentially reduce continued
          fracturing of the tooth. This way your dentist can perhaps save your
          fractured tooth. If you suspect that you have a fractured tooth, early
          intervention may be able to help save the tooth. By trying to save
          your tooth, the patient can help reduce more extensive treatment and
          higher costs. This would include having a dental extraction and dental
          implant placement. Unfortunately though, sometimes the tooth can not
          be saved. Now though, local dentists do have ways of providing good
          alternative dental care treatment options.
