          Root Canal Treatment or Root Canal Therapy (RCT) Virtual Discussion
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are millions of people globally who have root canal treatment
          (RCT) done on a yearly basis. If you have a tooth infection or a tooth
          abscess, then possibly you can save the tooth by having root canal
          treatment. Root canal treatment is only one step. After root canal
          treatment, the tooth may require a post & core and a dental crown, if
          there is substantial tooth structure loss. Sometimes, a dental filling
          after the root canal treatment may suffice if there is little tooth
          reduction done during RCT treatment.

        <p>
          A common dental root canal question is who can do RCT? Any licensed
          dentist can do your root canal treatment. Some dentists do not prefer
          to and will recommend a root canal specialist called an endodontist to
          perform RCT. An endodontist is a specialized dentist who specializes
          in root canal treatment and apicoectomy.

          After Root Canal Treatment Questions and Apicoectomy Treatments Chat
        </h4>
        <p>
          Sometimes, you as a patient may need RCT and apicoectomy treatment.
          Apicoectomy treatment is not common but unfortunately sometimes
          becomes necessary if an infection persists around the root tip. An
          apicoectomy is when your dentist or endodontist goes and removes the
          tip of the root tip under your gums. The tooth is then sealed around
          the apex of the root tip. This is a general explanation, but your
          dentist will provide a more thorough understanding of this procedure.
          This is not done commonly after root canal treatment.

          We will be discussing some of the factors in doing root canal
          treatment. A full dental examination first needs to be done. Root
          canal treatment depends on various factors. The type of tooth. Is it a
          molar or premolar tooth? Are there any other types of dental
          complications? Are there any types of root fractures?

        <p>
          Root canal treatment can be fairly straightforward, depending on the
          tooth. For front singular root teeth - such as anterior lateral teeth,
          then doing a single rooted root canal treatment can be fairly simple
          for an experienced dentist or endodontist.

          Common Virtual Root Canal Treatment Question - Root Canal Treatment or
          Tooth Extraction or Dental Implant Treatment?
        </h4>
        <p>
          A common root canal tooth question is the various options a patient
          has. Root canal treatment may be only one of the options. The patient
          will need to be provided with various options. For some patients, it
          may be preferable to do a tooth extraction or a tooth extraction &
          dental implant treatment as compared to doing a root canal treatment.
          For some people, they may not have dental insurance, and having a
          tooth extracted is usually cheaper than having say a molar tooth RTC.
          Hence, some people because of cost may consider having a tooth
          extraction rather than root canal treatment.
        </p>

          Root Canal Information Cost Discussion - Type of Tooth and RCT Costs:
        </h3>
        <p>
          Root canal treatment can be costly. It can be anywhere from several
          hundred dollars, to upwards of $2,000 for molar teeth being RCT at an
          endodontist office. Each dental practice has its own price points.
          Generally, molar teeth with a couple of canals and a couple of roots
          are more costly. The anatomy of teeth varies based on position. Front
          teeth are usually a single canal. It would usually only entail a
          single root and one canal (though this can vary). Hence, front teeth
          are usually cheaper or less costly than a molar root canal treatment.

          Steps to conduct virtual dentistry services - Live Teledental Steps

        </h4>
        <p>
          Here are some ways through which a local dentist can conduct virtual
          dentistry consultations. For root canal treatment, usually, dental
          X-rays are required to best analyze what is going on. If a tooth is
          very decayed, then most likely may require root canal therapy.
          Sometimes though, if the tooth caries is below the gum line or
          subgingival - then the tooth may need to be extracted.
        </p>
        <h4>Virtual Teledentist Scheduling Online:</h4>

          Root Canal Treatment virtual chatting, and Teledentistry RCT
          consultation information:
        </h4>
        <p>
          Root canal treatment is very effective in dealing with tooth
          infections. Dentists use RCT to repair or strengthen the damaged
          teeth. Root Canal Treatment is performed when a dentist can treat
          tooth decay without removing the decayed teeth. A patient can also
          attend a virtual dentistry consultation for root canal treatment
          information. The treatment is only possible to be performed in-office.
          However, complete information is necessary for the patient before
          undergoing any treatment to know how to deal with it. Here are some of
          the ways that can help to discuss RCT in a virtual teledentistry
          consultation call.
        </p>
        <h4>Discussion of RCT history and symptoms:</h4>
        <p>
          In a virtual Teledistry conference, the first thing that dentists need
          to discuss is the history and symptoms. Analyzing the tooth and dental
          X-rays is usually one of the first steps. Patients tell their dentist
          about the symptoms they are facing which mostly may include toothache,
          swelling of teeth, gums, or tooth sensitivity pain. Analyzing the
          dental health history of the patient is also important for a dentist
          before starting the root canal treatment. Many times a patient wants
          to understand the steps involved in root canal treatment. This can be
          easily discussed in the virtual session prior to the treatment
          procedure. People needing RTC may be experiencing a tooth abscess or a
          lot of tooth pain. If they have say a large hole in your tooth for
          several months, that tooth may become abscessed. Hence, the patient
          may require dental antibiotics and RTC to help save the tooth. First,
          of course, dental X-rays are required to do a proper full dental
          examination.
        </p>
        <h4>Visual root canal treatment and RCT dental exams:</h4>
        <p>
          Visual dental exams mean to use of imaging devices such as oral
          cameras to take photographs of the infected teeth. Patients provide
          these snaps or videos to their dentist virtually to let the dentist
          examine the teeth and prepare a report. This helps the dentist to
          perform the root canal treatment more effectively. For root canal
          treatment, this is vital. First, do a full dental x-ray examination
          and check for a tooth abscess.
        </p>
        <h4>Analyzing the diagnostic records and dental X-rays:</h4>
        <p>
          Most patients have a past record of various dental treatments or lack
          of them. Understanding and studying these, helps the dentist or
          endodontist better understand the patient’s dental history.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Explanation of full procedure, treatment, and any Dental Root Canal
          Questions discussion:
        </h4>
        <p>
          It is important that before RCT treatment, the patient should be fully
          aware of the procedure. Virtual root canal dentistry consultations
          allow the dentist to explain the full root canal treatment to the
          patient to help them understand the goal of the process. Dentists can
          use videos, or various dental models to explain the root canal
          procedure to patients. Before starting the procedure, the patient
          should understand what is required before and after the root canal
          treatment.
        </p>
        <h4>Root Canal Treatment Options Blogging Online:</h4>
        <p>
          After the visual assessments and report review, the dentist recommends
          the best option for the patient. Sometimes a Root Canal Treatment on
          the previously done root canal treatment is suggested to deal with the
          pain and swelling. Often a new RCT is required to be performed.
          Dentists discuss all the possible cases and treatment options with the
          patient to let them know about the risks, procedures, and benefits of
          the selected treatment.

        <p>
          Teeth that have root canal treatment, can be more susceptible to
          fracture - especially if not properly restored. It is good for the
          patient to know about the chance of complications that may possibly
          happen due to root canal treatment. Sometimes, people have RTC and do
          not get the crown or tooth restoration that they need afterward.

        <h4>RCT Post Treatment and Root Canal Therapy Post-op Guide:</h4>
        <p>
          Post-treatment guide is important for every procedure. It helps to get
          long-lasting results after the treatment. In virtual consultations.
          Dentists can also educate the patient about the instructions that need
          to be followed to get better outcomes. Scheduling a post-operative
          appointment with the dentist is also important to ensure perfect oral
          health.
        </p>
        These are the root canal treatment steps that patients can easily
        undergo virtually. However, it is important to know that the actual RCT
        procedure is only possible when the patient visits the local dentist.
