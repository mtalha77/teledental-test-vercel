        <p>
          If you suffer from having darkly stained teeth due to smoking, coffee
          stains or other superficial staining, teeth whitening can improve your
          teeth appearance. Bleaching techniques have attracted much interest as
          they are non-invasive and relatively simple to carry out either in the
          dental office or even at home using a home-based whitening system.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>In-office Bleaching </strong>
          starts with applying a protection system for the gum. Then, a gel is
          added on the teeth. Sometimes, the dentist uses a high intensity light
          along with 35% peroxide gel to start the whitening process. The light
          activates peroxide, oxidizing the stains on the teeth. You will notice
          the stains fade immediately after the dental visit, thus making your
          teeth appear lighter. Results may vary according to each unique
          situation but it definitely can improve the color of your teeth to a
          very remarkable degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Home-based systems </strong>use 20% peroxide but for a longer
          time, lasting for two weeks. The most common side effects caused by
          bleaching are tooth sensitivity, and irritations on your gums. The
          best solution to avoid sensitivity is to use a fluoride gel or
          sensitive toothpaste prior to the bleaching visit.

           Composite Bonding Teledental Discussion:
          </h3>
        </p>
        <p>
          Dental composite resin is a tooth-colored restorative material used to
          replace a decayed, chipped or broken tooth structure. The main
          advantage over other filling materials is its esthetic appearance.
          Composite bonding is a very simple cosmetic dental procedure and it
          doesn’t require multiple visits to the dentist. And in some simple
          cases it doesn't typically require anesthesia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dental bonding doesn’t have any major risks, their side effects are
          minimal. Composite resin used with bonding procedure isn’t as strong
          as your natural teeth. It’s possible for the restoration to chip or
          separate from your tooth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The resin also isn’t as stain-resistant as other dental materials
          (porcelain – ceramics). So, you may develop some discoloration if you
          smoke or drink a lot of coffee and colored food.

          The word veneer means a thin decorative covering, which means not all
          the tooth surfaces are covered with the restoration as in crowns. They
          are simply an added cover to an existing tooth to improve its shape
          and appearance. Many people are starting to use Local Teledentistry
          Dental Veneer Consulting Online or Teledental Veneers Consultation
          with live virtual dental consulting. The greatest advantage of dental
          veneers treatment is the great improvement of aesthetics with minimal
          tooth preparation.

            Veneers are the optimal option when you have multiple issues such
            as:
          </h3>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Discolored teeth when bleaching is not effective.</li>
          <li>
            Chipped, cracked, or broken teeth, when there is no need to have a
            crown.
          </li>
          <li>
            Minor shape corrections as in slightly malformed or tilted teeth.
          </li>
          <li>Teeth spacing and diastema.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Removable Veneers </strong>
          also known as Snap-on veneers, are an option that may be right for
          some patients as permanent veneers requiring multiple dental visits
          and teeth preparation that comes at a considerable cost. Removable
          veneers avoid many of these downsides. They can give you a completely
          different smile while hiding your original teeth. However, they are
          temporary cosmetic solution and not recommended without the approval
          of a dental professional.

          A dental crown is the most common dental restoration used for
          aesthetics purposes, it can improve your smile by modifying teeth
          size, shape, color, and alignment. Crowns and bridges also play a
          major role in restoring missing teeth and hence improving esthetics.

          <strong>Porcelain Crowns </strong>are the most popular type of crowns,
          they are entirely made of porcelain material. They are matching your

        <p>
          Both inlays and onlays are restorations that have been constructed out
          of the mouth then cemented into the prepared tooth cavity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main difference is, inlays go inside cavities; while onlays
          usually go on top of a tooth cusp to replace a bit of it and the
          adjoining surface of the tooth. Onlays repair larger areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          They can be made from tooth-colored restorative materials (porcelain
          and composite resin). New materials -specifically the new CAD/CAM
          zirconia-based systems-are available now for restorative cosmetic
          treatment options. These restorations satisfy the high patient
          expectations for a natural appearance.

          <li>A fixed bridge and it needs reduction of adjacent teeth.</li>
          <li>
            An implant, an artificial tooth root (made from titanium) anchored
            in place of a missing tooth. Implants have become the gold standard
            in replacing missing teeth in place of fixed partial dentures to
            replace a single tooth or even the entire arch.
