          We will be discussing various local dental emergencies and local
          emergency teledental services available for people with their local
          teledentist of ice. A local dental emergency such as chipping a tooth
          or severe toothache pain can happen for a variety of reasons.

          We will discuss some of the reasons people have
          <i>
            <u> local dental emergencies</u>
          </i>
          . As we will discuss, generally it is a good idea when having a broken
          tooth or a chipped composite tooth filling, to go and visit your local
          dental office to get the tooth fixed as soon as can. Why? Because a
          small chipped tooth can become a larger broken tooth if the tooth chip
          continues to fracture when you chew on it. If the tooth is fractured
          to a large extent, then your local dentist may recommend getting a
          dental crown possibly - if a lot of the tooth has broken off. Dental
          crowns usually cost more and take longer usually to make.

          <p style={{ textIndent: "50px" }}>
            Chipped or broken teeth can result from issues such as a cavity that
            has damaged your teeth, biting a hard food or object, or getting hit
            in the mouth. Broken teeth are considered a dental emergency that
            must be treated by a dental professional, but pain from a broken
            tooth can be temporarily treated by taking over-the-counter pain
            medication such as ibuprofen until a dental appointment can be
            attended. Depending on the severity of the broken or chipped tooth,
            the tooth will either need to simply be repaired, or full removed
            and replaced. People are now using Teledental Broken Tooth
            Consultation Online to get dental suggestions. Using Teledental
            Tooth Consulting can help provide your dentist a better idea of what
            is going on with the tooth, before seeing you at the dental office.
            Any time you have a chipped tooth or broken tooth, it is a good idea
            to get dental x-rays and get the tooth fixed with a filling,
            inlay/onlay or dental crown possibly. The patient should ask for a
            good dental treatment plan and dental options.

            Tooth sensitivity, or dentin hypersensitivity, is a tenderness or
            discomfort felt by teeth as a result of exposure to stimuli such as
            hot or cold food, beverages, or air. Tooth sensitivity can be caused
            by excessively grinding your teeth or brushing your teeth too hard.
            Tooth sensitivity can also be related to cavities or root damage,
            making it essential to visit a dentist in order to locate the source
            of the problem. Usually because the dental enamel layer of the tooth
            has worn out, then the more sensitive dentin layer can become
            exposed. People can do a Sensitive Tooth Teledentistry Consultation
            Online to get dental suggestions from a local teledental office.

          <p style={{ textIndent: "50px" }}>
            Tooth avulsion is the full dislocation of a tooth from its socket.
            Avulsion leads to necrosis and hypoxia of the tooth pulp. Following
            avulsion, the tooth should be replanted within an hour after the
            avulsion has occurred. Primary teeth should never be replaced and
            only permanent teeth should be replanted - preferably by your local
            dentist as soon as can. Now with teledentistry consultation - if you
            are in a remote place â€¦. A local teledentist may provide some
            guidance of what to do.

          <p style={{ textIndent: "50px" }}>
            Common orthodontic problems include underbites and crowding. An
            underbite, or prognathism, occurs when the lower teeth overlap the
            upper teeth in a malocclusion. Underbites are typically caused by
            the misalignment of the lower jaw, which can lead to persistent jaw
            pain, headaches, tooth decay, and halitosis, and sleep apnea. Teeth
            crowding diminishes the space between teeth, which makes it more
            difficult to brush and floss your teeth properly. As a result,
            plaque and bacteria can form more easily, which can lead to decaying
            teeth and gum disease. Treating orthodontic problems can begin from
            a young age, by limiting thumb sucking, pacifiers, and tongue
            thrusting. Braces can also be used to correct teeth alignment.
            People with orthodontics braces may have their ortho wire become
            loose or a bracket to fall out. They need to be careful, because the
            loose ortho wire may cut the gums or cheek. They should see their
            orthodontist or dentist as soon as can. People who can not go right
            away to their dentist, may use carefully ortho wax to hold the wire
            in place. It is best to see your dentist or orthodontist as soon as
            can.

            Gum disease, or periodontitis, occurs when harmful bacteria grows in
            your mouth and destroys the tissue around your teeth, which can
            ultimately lead to tooth loss. Gum disease generally begins with
            gingivitis, or gum inflammation, that causes bacteria and plaque
            buildup that then attacks the bone and connective tissue that secure
            teeth in their socket. Gum disease is the primary cause of tooth
            loss in adults. Depending on the severity of the gum disease, either
            surgical or nonsurgical treatments can be applied in order to repair
            connective tissue. Gum disease can cause loose teeth. This can cause
            tooth pain when chewing on food. Should visit a periodontist or
            dentist as soon as possible, to get full dental exam, dental x-rays
            and dental treatment.

            Composite fillings are used to fix issues such as tooth decay,
            cracks, and fractures. Composite fillings are tooth-colored, which
            can make them more aesthetically pleasing than silver amalgam
            fillings, but composite fillings are typically more costly than
            silver amalgam fillings. Composite fillings are not permanent and
            usually need to be replaced every 5-10 years, though this can vary.
            Composite fillings can provide a good tooth filling restoration
            treatment. Large composite fillings that cover larger areas of the
            tooth, are more susceptible of breaking or chipping. People can do

          <p style={{ textIndent: "50px" }}>
            A tooth abscess is a pocket of pus that results from bacterial
            infection. A tooth abscess can be caused by a dental cavity that has
            not been treated, an injury, or previous dental work. An abscess
            must be drained in order to remove the infection. The tooth can
            sometimes be saved with a root canal, but in more severe cases the
            tooth may need to be removed. One way your dentist may recommend to
            do this is with root canal therapy. Sometimes may be able to get a
            local teledental tooth infection antibiotics prescription before
            going to the dental office. Anytime you have a tooth infection,
            should see a dentist or doctor as soon as possible.
