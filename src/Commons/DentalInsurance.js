          Local Virtual Dental Insurance vs Best Discount Dental Plan Discussion
          - Live Teledental Dental Insurance Coverage Information Blog and Local
          Virtual Dentist Chatting about Dental Plans:
        </h2>
        <p>
          Dental insurance and dental plans play an important part of dentistry.
          A majority of people in the USA are covered by some sort of dental
          insurance plan or discount dental plan. A dental insurance company is
          much different than a discount dental plan company. Dental discount
          plans are limited by having only a discount at participating dentists.
          As we will discuss, many of the major dental insurance companies are
          now covering the charge for a live teledentistry or teledental
          consultation exam. These are a virtual dental examination via video
          between a dentist and a patient. Patients need to confirm with their
          dental insurance company if they provide this service coverage or not.
          We will discuss dental insurance, dental plans and teledentistry
          virtual dental care in this local teledental dental insurance blog.

        <h3>What is a dental insurance company?</h3>
        <p>
          There are different types of dental insurance companies. But in
          general a dental insurance company provides financial relief in
          different formats and extents to patients for their dental treatments.

        <h3>
          What is the difference between Dental Plan and Dental Insurance?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Dental insurance is similar to other types of insurance. Policyholders
          are responsible for paying monthly premiums to the insurance company
          to be covered. The dental insurance company assumes the risk of dental
          expenses. Policyholders usually pay a portion of the cost ( for
          example, deductibles, copayments, coinsurance) for covered dental
          services, and the insurance company pays the remaining amount, up to
          the limit of policy. Dental insurance plans usually have networks of
          dentists who have opted for negotiated fees for covered services.
          Utilizing in-network dentist usually results in lower out-of-pocket
          costs for policyholders. Dental insurance plans have several drawbacks
          like waiting periods, deductibles, annual maximums, and other
          limitations on coverage.

          Live Dentist Talk about Dental Discount Plans and Virtual Dental Plan
          Discussion Online
        </h3>
        <p>
          Dental plans, also known as discount dental plans or dental savings
          plans, offer membership programs rather than insurance policies.
          Members pay an annual or monthly fee to join the dental plan rather
          than paying regular premiums. These dental plans provide discounted
          rates to members with participating dentists for a wide range of
          dental services. Extent of discounts varies on the plan and dental
          procedure. A key difference from dental insurance is that, dental plan
          companies do not assume the risk of dental expenses. Therefore,
          members need to pay the full discounted fee at the time of service.
          Benefits of these plans are that generally they donâ€™t have waiting
          periods, deductibles, or annual maximums. Members can use their plan
          benefits immediately after joining. To summarize, dental insurance
          involves payment of premiums to an insurance company in exchange for
          coverage that includes cost-sharing arrangements for dental services.
          On the other hand, Dental plan companies, offer membership programs
          that involve discounted rates for dental services without the
          assumption of risk or cost sharing typical of regular insurance. With
          the dental discount plans, the patient can only go to participating
          dentists.

          Here are some common live teledentist questions we get asked. Is teeth
          whitening procedure at the dental office covered by most dental
          insurance plans? How many people do not have dental insurance in the
          USA? What is basic dental insurance coverage?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Most dental insurance plans do not cover teeth whitening in-office
          dental treatment. Around 68.5 million individuals in the United States
          do not have dental insurance. Usually major dental insurance companies
          with PPO plans have 3 levels of coverage. Basic coverage which is
          usually 80% covered are things such as composite fillings. The other
          20 percent is usually paid by the patient. Each dental insurance
          company is different, so best to check the fee schedule and ask your
          dental insurance company prior to visiting your local dentist.

        <h3>What is the difference between Dental HMO and Dental PPO?</h3>
        <p>
          Dental HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) and Dental PPO (Preferred
          Provider Organization) are two common types of dental insurance plans.
          Both of these dental plans have their own characteristics and
          differences.

          Talk with Live Dentists about dental insurance coverage - Preventive
          Dental Care Coverage Chatting with a Live Dentist:
        </h3>
        <p>
          Preventive dental care is considered to be periodic dental exams,
          dental X-rays and periodic dental prophylaxis (prophy) cleanings.
          These preventive dental services are usually covered by most major
          dental insurance companies at 100 percent. That is, the patient
          usually does not have to pay a co-payment. A dental prophy cleaning is
          usually allowed twice a year for example. Now, as we will discuss
          further - virtual dental exam is considered a form of preventive
          dental examination by some major dental insurance companies. The
          patient will need to confirm and check about this. Live Dentist Talk
          or Virtual Dentistry is here and growing. This is called Teledental or
          Teledentistry care.

          Virtual Dental HMO Plan Information with Live Dentists and
          Teledentistry Dental Insurance Blogging Online:
        </h3>
        <p>
          Dental HMO (DHMO) plans generally have to select a primary dentist
          from a network of dentists who have agreed to provide services at
          negotiated rates. To see a specialist, referral from a primary dentist
          is usually needed. In general, DHMO dental plans have cheaper premiums
          and fixed copayments. That is coinsurance for covered dental services.
          However, there might be limited options for dentists and services. The
          patient may need to pay the entire cost if you choose to see an out of
          network dentist. On the other hand, Dental PPO (DPPO) allows the
          patient to visit any dentist, whether they're in network or
          out-of-network. The out-of-pocket costs for various dental treatments
          are usually lower when you visit an in-network dentist. No referrals
          are needed to see a specialist within DPPO plan. The premiums are
          higher than DHMO plans. The dental patient may have deductibles,
          coinsurance, and annual maximums. Many times a maximum amount of
          dental coverage or payment is present. There are basic and major
          treatment plan prices. For example, a dental composite filling may be
          covered at a 80 percent level. For dental crowns, the dental insurance
          plan may cover only 50 percent of the fees. The rest is payable by the
          patient out of pocket. The dental patient should understand the
          percentage of the costs that are covered for various dental services.

          Organization (PPO) plans, and Dental Health Maintenance Organization
