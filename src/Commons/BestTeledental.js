        <h3>What Teledental Means?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Teledental</strong> is a combination of telecommunications and
          dentistry. It is a category of Telehealth, which refers to the
          entirety of remote and/or technology-driven healthcare services,
          virtual medical health, and educational services. Virtual health care
          is growing in all of medicine. This is known as telemedicine or
          telehealth care. Virtual dental care is known as{" "}
          <i>Teledental Care</i> or <i>Local Teledentistry Consulting</i>. This
          is basically a form of virtual dentistry.
          <strong>Teledental health</strong> is concerned with a patient's oral
          health at a distance by doing it remotely to provide necessary and
          urgent dental care, through the exchange of clinical information and
          images for consultation and dental treatment planning. It improves
          access and delivery of oral healthcare and lowers its costs.

            place between patients and dentist via communications technology
            including video and audio conference in which a dental professional
            and the patient, at different locations, may see, hear, and
            communicate with each other.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dentists can provide an evaluation regarding ongoing care routines
            or assesses the progress of past treatments. And finally answers
            questions about pain or other dental situations.

          Teledentistry and Teledental is NOT an alternative method to deliver
          the existing dental services. Despite its great benefits it also
          involves some of the following limitations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Technical problems, such as lack of computer skills or often slowed
            by unreliable internet connections.
          </li>
          <li>
            Accuracy limitations: due to the lack of face-to-face physical
            examination.
          </li>
          <li>
            Treatment limitations: most of the dental problems involving pain
            and requires intervention, either with conservative or surgical
            procedures.
          </li>
          <li>
            Patients’ information is to be transmitted electronically with the
            possibility of information interception, despite the maximum efforts
            to maintain security.
          </li>
          <li>
            Potentials of the inherent risk of improper diagnosis and/or
            treatment due to insufficiency of the technology involved.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some teledentistry is being covered by some Delta Dental
            Teledentistry Plans - though many dental insurance companies do not
            cover or support teledentistry. This trend is reversing - as dental
            insurance companies are starting to see the benefits of local
            teledentistry services and online teledental consultation. Also, the
            benefits of online virtual teledental antibiotics prescription that
            can be done - if done correctly.
