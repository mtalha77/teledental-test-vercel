          <p>
            Teledental was conceived by a dedicated team of professionals,

            care. Our founders were the pioneers behind DentalChat.com over 12
            years ago. Enabling live dental chats with dentists in real-time. As
            telehealth and dental telemedicine evolved, we embraced the emerging
            technology, adapting to its limitations.

            As a leading innovator in the virtual dental care domain, Teledental
            aims to expand access to dental expertise and information. Though we
            do not replace traditional dental care, we provide invaluable
            support for users seeking dental advice or second opinions. Users
            are encouraged to exercise their own judgment and perform due
            diligence in making dental decisions.

          <p>
            While virtual live dentist consultations via Teledental offer
            numerous benefits, there are inherent limitations. Teledental
            services can provide helpful suggestions, potential antibiotic
            prescriptions, and dental second opinions. However, patients still
            need to visit their local dental practice for comprehensive dental
            care, x-rays, and full intraoral in-office examinations.
