      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">1. Sleep Apnea and Oral Health</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600">
        Sleep apnea is a condition where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep, leading to snoring, dry mouth, and fatigue. Many people don’t realize that <strong>dentists play a crucial role</strong> in detecting and managing sleep apnea. Signs like worn-down teeth, jaw misalignment, and a narrow airway can indicate a sleep disorder. <strong>Custom oral appliances</strong> from a dentist can help keep the airway open, improving both sleep quality and oral health.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">2. Teeth Grinding (Bruxism) and Jaw Pain</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600">
        If you wake up with jaw pain, headaches, or sensitive teeth, you might be grinding your teeth at night. Bruxism can lead to <strong>tooth wear, fractures, and TMJ disorders</strong>. A dentist can provide a <strong>custom mouthguard</strong> to prevent damage and relieve jaw tension. If you suspect grinding but aren’t sure, virtual consultations on <strong>Teledental.com</strong> can help assess your symptoms and recommend solutions.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">3. Dry Mouth and Increased Cavity Risk</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600">
        Many people sleep with their mouth open, leading to chronic dry mouth. <strong>Saliva is essential</strong> for neutralizing acids and preventing bacteria buildup. Without it, you’re at a higher risk for cavities and gum disease. <strong>AI-powered dental X-ray diagnostics</strong> can detect early signs of decay caused by dry mouth, allowing for proactive treatment.
