          dentist will first check to make sure your teeth have been cleaned and
          you have gotten proper dental prophy cleaning or some sort of scaling
          dental cleaning prior to doing teeth whitening usually - as all debris
          should be removed from your teeth prior to having teeth whitening.

          Proper tooth brushing and flossing is important, so as to not allow
          plaque to accumulate. Hardened plaque can become what is called
          calculus - which your dentist will need to scale off. Plaque builds up
          overtime, and can actually permanently yellow and stain your teeth.
          Getting regular dental prophy cleanings - usually twice a year is a
          good way of maintaining good oral hygiene. Having regular dental exams
          and dental x-rays with your local dentist, can be a good way of having
          good oral health. This with proper good oral care on a daily basis
          with proper tooth brushing & flossing, will help in preventing plaque
          from accumulating to stain and discolor your teeth.

          Common teeth whitening questions are many times about whitening
          toothpaste and teeth bleaching / teeth whitening procedures. Whitening
          toothpastes come in a variety of brands with Colgate and Crest being 2
          of the more popular ones. Though there are other ones that can perform
          well - though people should understand the limitations. Whitening
          toothpastes are generally using some form of teeth staining removing
          agents such as silica an abrasive ingredient or sometimes hydrogen
          peroxide - to whiten the teeth. It is important to read the
          instructions on teeth whitening toothpaste products. Virtual teeth
          bleaching information or teledental teeth whitening consultations can
          be done with your dentist - prior to treatment if you have dental
          teeth whitening questions that need answering. Hydrogen peroxide you
          need to be careful with and to use under dentist supervision. The
          hydrogen peroxide does breakdown some of the yellowing properties -
          but it does have limitations and should be used in the right
          proportions. Usually, take home dental whitening gel is for instance a
          weaker concentrate so as to not damage the teeth. It is good to ask
          your dentist and dental office for guidelines and to understand fully
          the treatment plan.

          Teeth whitening can be an effective method of whitening teeth, though
          there are limitations. In-office dental teeth whitening can usually be
          a more profound whitening, since your dentist can use a stronger
          whitening material - though this may cause teeth sensitivity. It is
          important to cover any areas of the teeth that are sensitive prior to
          teeth whitening. If doing a teledentistry teeth whitening consultation
          - it is good to get a general idea of what will be happening and to
          discuss if have any teeth sensitivity, prior to treatment. Many times

          help in doing this. Your dental office may provide some sort of take
          home dental bleaching tray and gel, for you to take home as well.

          feel something is not right - should not further do and ask your
          dentist to check out.
