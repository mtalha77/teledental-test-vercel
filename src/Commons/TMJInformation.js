        The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is the joint that attaches the jawbone
        to the right and left sides of the skull.

        The jawbone attaches to the temporal bone, which is one of the bones
        that make up the sides of the skull. The way the jaw and temporal bone
        attach is important in many ways. Some people can end up having pain and
        aches in this area - which is generally termed as TMJ pain or TMJ
        problem.

      <p>
        TMD is an abbreviation for temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Any
        disease or disorder of the jaw joint is included. It is important to get
        proper digital x-rays and a full dental exam, to make sure what is going
        on. Teledental TMJ consulting and TMD Teledentistry virtual consultation
        can provide some general information. Your dentist or doctor will need
        to figure out what is causing the TMJ pain.
      </p>

      <p>TMD dysfunction can cause pain and discomfort for people.</p>

      <p>
        Some causes may be temporary, but if left untreated, the problem that is
        causing joint dysfunction will usually worsen over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Given the importance of jaw function to quality of life, it is best to
        seek professional dental as soon as possible rather than waiting until
        the problem becomes unbearable. Get answers to your TMJ concerns
