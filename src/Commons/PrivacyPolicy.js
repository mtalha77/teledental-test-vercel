        <p>
          I understand that my health care provider wishes me to engage in a
          telemedicine consultation. 2. My health care provider has explained to
          me how the video conferencing technology will be used to affect such a
          consultation will not be the same as a direct patient/health care
          provider visit due to the fact that I will not be in the same room as
          my health care provider. 3. I understand there are potential risks to
          this technology, including interruptions, unauthorized access and
          technical difficulties. I understand that my healthcare provider or I
          can discontinue the telemedicine consult/visit if it is felt that the
          videoconferencing connections are not adequate for the situation. 4. I
          understand that my healthcare information may be shared with other
          individuals for scheduling and billing purposes. Others may also be
          present during the consultation other than my health care provider and
          consulting health care provider in order to operate the video
          equipment. The above-mentioned people will all maintain the
          confidentiality of the information obtained. I further understand that
          I will be informed of their presence in the consultation and thus will
          have the right to request the following: (1) omit specific details of
          my medical history/physical examination that are personally sensitive
          to me; (2) ask non-medical personnel to leave the telemedicine
          examination room: and or (3) terminate the consultation at any time.
          5. I have had the alternatives to a telemedicine consultation
          explained to me, and in choosing to participate in a
        </p>
        <p>
          telemedicine consultation. I understand that some parts of the exam
          involving physical tests may be conducted by individuals at my
          location at the direction of the consulting health care provider. 6.
          In an emergent consultation, I understand that the responsibility of
          the telemedicine consulting specialist is to advise my local
          practitioner and that the specialist’s responsibility will conclude
          upon the termination of the video conference connection. 7. I
          understand that billing will occur from both my practitioner and as a
          facility fee from the site from which I am presented. 8. I have had a
          direct conversation with my doctor, during which I had the opportunity
          to ask questions in regard to this procedure. My questions have been
          answered and the risks, benefits and any practical alternatives have
          been discussed with me in a language in which I understand. Any person
          using our teledental or telemedicine video consulting, agrees to these
