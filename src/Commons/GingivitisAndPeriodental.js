          Gingivitis and periodontal problems are much more common than people
          realize. If your gums bleed easily when you floss and brush your teeth
          - then you may be having some sort of periodontal problem.

          Both Periodontitis and Gingivitis is a form of gum inflammation - that
          we will be discussing further in this local periodontal blog. Though
          as we will discuss, periodontitis is a much more severe progression of
          this gum disease. People may notice their teeth becoming loose or
          mobile. Can you do an <i>online teledental periodontal consulting</i>{" "}
          - yes. Your
          <i>local teledentist</i> will do a general view of your gums, so they
          have a better idea of what may be needed when they go in for
          periodontal treatment.

        <h3>
          Gingivitis Teledental Information - What is Gingivitis and
          Periodontitis?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Gingivitis is an inflammation and/or swelling of the gums caused by a
          bacterial infection. If gingivitis is left untreated, it can progress
          to a more severe form of gum disease called Periodontitis. This can
          happen to adults and teenagers. For teenagers, a form of juvenile
          periodontitis can occur - which is characterized by severe dental bone
          loss around certain areas of the mouth. Gingivitis occurs many times
          for people who do not maintain good oral hygiene by brushing and
          flossing daily. Teledental gingivitis consultation does happen for
          people who are concerned about large plaque growth or gum
          inflammation. Patients will still need dental treatment in the dental
          office which may include dental prophy or dental scaling and root
          planing
        </p>
        <h3>Periodontitis Meaning</h3>
        <p>
          The main difference between Gingivitis and Periodontitis is that
          Gingivitis is easily reversible with appropriate professional and home
          care whereas Periodontitis is irreversible as it is accompanied by
          bone loss, which cannot be recovered.
        </p>
        <h3>Healthy Gingiva</h3>
        <p>
          A healthy gum looks pink, firm and does not bleed when brushing or
          flossing. Bleeding gums is one of the best indicators that something
          may be wrong. On the other hand, if you are a smoker, these symptoms
          can be masked, as in smokers, it does not become red, swollen and
          bleed, and the only means to diagnose it, is by a dentist.
        </p>
        <h3>Beginning Signs of Gingivitis</h3>
        <p>Patients with Gingivitis may have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Red, puffy, swollen gums</li>
          <li>
            Gums that are tender and easily bleed while brushing or flossing
          </li>
          <li>Foul breath</li>
          <li>Pain in the gums</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Early Signs of Periodontitis</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Swollen, tender, bleeding gums</li>
          <li>Teeth look longer because gums have receded</li>
          <li>Gums separated from teeth creating deep pockets</li>
          <li>New spaces between teeth</li>
          <li>Loose teeth</li>
          <li>Constant bad breath or bad taste in the mouth</li>
          <li>Pus coming between gums and teeth</li>
          <li>Changes in the way dental appliances fit</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Dental Plaque</h3>
        <p>
          Plaque is the main cause of Gum disease. Plaque starts to form the
          moment you finish brushing your teeth and if it left to accumulate
          undisturbed for longer than two days, it can begin to cause
          gingivitis. If it is left for an even longer period of time, plaque
          can solidify and form tartar. The tartar can retain even more plaque
          as it has a rougher surface.
          <br />
          If gingivitis is not treated, it can lead to a much more serious
          condition called Periodontitis which is one of the leading causes of
          tooth loss in adults. Periodontitis causes loss of bone that supports
          the teeth and can form deep pockets in the gum.
          <br />
          Many gum disease symptoms do not appear until the disease is well
          established. Hence, it is important to know the risk factors for gum
          disease.
        </p>
        <h3>Causes of Unhealthy Gingiva</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Poor oral hygiene</li>
          <li>
            Hormonal changes such as during pregnancy, puberty or menopause.
          </li>
          <li>Smoking</li>
          <li>Illnesses such as diabetes, leukaemia and Crohn disease</li>
          <li>Medications that lessen the flow of saliva in mouth</li>
          <li>Family history</li>
          <li>Ill-fitting dental restoration</li>
          <li>Stress</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Inflamed Gingiva Complications</h3>
        <p>
          Untreated gum disease can extend downward and affect tissue around and
          under teeth. It includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Abscess or infection in the gingiva or jaw bones</li>
          <li>Loss of teeth</li>
          <li>Trench mouth</li>
          <li>
            It is also linked to other serious illnesses such as heart diseases
            and diabetes
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How is Gingivitis treated?</h3>
        <p>
          If diagnosis happens early, and if treatment is proper and prompt,
          gingivitis can be successfully reversed. It includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Thorough teeth cleaning by a Dental professional to remove plaque
            and tartar.
          </li>
          <li>
            Good oral hygiene with at-home practices such as brushing twice a
            day and flossing at least once a day. Tooth brushing is especially
            important at night before going to bed, as there is less saliva in
            the mouth to wash away the bacteria.
          </li>
          <li>
            Regular dental check ups at the dentist, at least once a year.
          </li>
          <li>Treatment of underlying conditions.</li>
        </ul>

          <p>
            Periodontal laser therapy is not a standalone treatment but used in
            conjunction with traditional therapies. It is a tissue preserving
            procedure that ensures that no gum tissue is reduced to a lower
            level on purpose. Perio dental laser teledentistry consulting is
            growing, as people want to get a virtual general idea of what is
            happening or going to happen. Local teledental laser consultation
            may continue to grow, as more people are interested in understanding
            more about laser dental therapy.
            <br />
            In this procedure, the dentist uses a laser to access an infected
            pocket to kill the infected tissue and bacteria. It removes the
            inflamed gum tissue around the roots and then tartar and plaque
            below the gumline is removed.
            <br />
            Benefits of laser therapy:
            <ul style={{ listStyle: "decimal" }}>
              <li>
                Shorter healing time It causes less trauma to the gums and teeth
                which reduces healing time and recovery is faster.
              </li>
              <li>
                Less bleeding, pain and swelling Periodontal laser therapy is a
                less invasive procedure compared to traditional surgical
                procedure which causes less bleeding as well as less pain and
                swelling.
              </li>
              <li>
                It can be performed under Local anaesthesia eliminating the need
                for a general anaesthetic which is required for certain surgical
                periodontal procedures.
              </li>
              <li>It reduces post-operative sensitivity.</li>

                It can be optimised for patients Based on the level of
                periodontal disease, the wavelength and power level of the laser
                beam can be adjusted providing a dental treatment that is
                uniquely personalised for individual patient.

            <p>
              The goal of this surgery is to remove pockets of space between
              teeth and bone that will eliminate the room for bacteria, plaque,
              and tartar to accumulate. It is a procedure where the gums are
              lifted back, and plaque and tartar are removed from the deeper
              pockets. The gums are then back to its place by suturing around
              the tooth.
