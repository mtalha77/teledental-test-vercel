        <p>
          Dental erosion and teeth sensitivity are different dental challenges
          that patients suffer from. Although these three concepts are related,
          they differ in some ways. You want to know what the difference is with
          them and their similarities. But before we go into that, let me
          swiftly tell you that in case you have any dental health-related
          questions, No worries, Teledental Blog got you covered. On our blog,
          you can read about different dental topics. You could also book a live
          session with any of our professional dentists at any time you get
          preoccupied with the questions. We are one of the best in the
          Teledentistry space in the USA. Nevertheless, in this blog
          particularly, we will be discussing teeth sensitivity and erosion of
          teeth. We will also be discussing virtual dentistry and teledental
          care.

        <p>
          To start with, dental erosion, on the one hand, refers to the loss of
          the surface of your teeth owing to the acids you eat or drink, or
          acids coming up from your stomach. These acids can wash out the rigid
          substance that makes up your teeth, leading to tooth surface loss.
          Acid can also soften the tooth surface to make it less difficult for
          it to be worn away through abrasion or teeth grinding. This act is
          seen as acid wear or erosive tooth wear. <br /> On the other hand,
          tooth sensitivity is a painful condition that manifests when the inner
          (dentine) layer of the tooth is exposed. It is an overstated reaction
          to stimuli like hot, cold, acidic foods and drinks. It also refers to
          the pain that emanates due to exposure to cold air and brushing of
          teeth. This condition can evolve as a result of receding gums.
          However, toothache is the general pain that a person feels in their
          mouth. <br /> Many patients are oblivious to this fact. Therefore,
          many question the reasons for the pain they feel when they brush, eat,
          and drink.
        </p>
        <h4>Questions about tooth pain when drinking cold drinks</h4>
        <p>
          You must have been wondering why you feel some kind of sharp pain when
          you drink cold or hot water or drinks. This is what we call teeth
          sensitivity. You aren’t the only one baffled by this experience.
          Millions of people experience the same. But wait, why teeth
          sensitivity?
        </p>
        <h4>Teledentist Teeth Sensitivity Inquiries Blogging</h4>
        <p>
          You see, to understand teeth sensitivity, you first have to know the
          structural composition of the teeth. Each tooth comprises the crown
          (the conspicuous part of the tooth) and the root (anchors each tooth
          into your jaw). For better clarity, we shall have to discuss the
          components of the crown.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Outer tooth enamel: This is the hard and whitish layer that guides
            the sensitive inner parts of each tooth. Tooth enamel is the
            strongest material in your body even stronger than the bone.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cementum tooth layer: The Cementum tooth layer is the thin and
            protective layer of the tooth. Cementum is similar to the bone
            tissue and is located beneath the gum line. It safeguards the tooth
            root.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dentin tooth layer: A layer of softer tissue that contains tiny
            canals or “tubules.”
          </li>
          <li>
            Tooth Pulp Area: The soft tissue deep inside each tooth that
            includes blood vessels, connective tissue, and nerves. This is the
            tooth pulp area of the tooth.
          </li>
          <li>
            If it happens that the tooth enamel layer begins to wear down and
            erode, then your tooth’s dentin is exposed. The dentin area is much
            more vital and sensitive. When the dentin layer is exposed, then the
            nerve sends a message to the tooth root and afterward to the brain
            which means that things like eating popsicles or drinking hot
            drinks, which usually do not cause a reaction, can suddenly trigger
            pain and sensitivity.
          </li>

          Talking with Live Dentists about Sensitive Tooth Question Online
          Virtually:
        </h3>
        <p>
          Many people have live virtual sensitive tooth questions or inquiries.
          Why? Well because so many people have worn away their dental enamel
          and are having sensitive tooth or teeth. As a dentist, if we notice
          enamel wear around the facial surface of teeth - then that is probably
          the main cause of the teeth sensitivity. Once your tooth enamel is
          worn down and the underlying tooth dentin is exposed, then the dentist
          will probably have that area of the mouth to be further evaluated at a
          local dental office. Most likely, the patient may require composite
          fillings or a composite filling.

          Teledentistry Consultation and Questions Discussion - Common Live
          Dentist Questions about what are the Causes of Teeth Sensitivity.{" "}
        </h4>
        <p>
          Several factors could be responsible for teeth sensitivity. But all
          these can be categorized into two broad parts: enamel loss and gum
          recession
          <ul>
            <li>
              Enamel wear and loss: This can be caused by two factors:
              overzealous brushing and acidic erosion. Brushing too vigorously
              and too often can lead to enamel loss. Similarly, too sweet foods
              and drinks also cause this loss.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              Gum recession: This can be caused by brushing with a hard brush.
              In addition, a common oral health disease known as gum disease
              also recedes the gum which in turn causes teeth sensitivity. More
              so, smoking can trigger this, as well as the gene. Some persons
              get teeth sensitivity by inheritance irrespective of how they take
              care of their teeth.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Tooth Pain Chatting and Erosion of Teeth Discussion</h4>
        <p>
          Erosion of teeth or teeth worn down can be caused by different
          reasons. One of the more common reasons for the erosion of the teeth
          is stomach acid. The stomach comprises many strong acids that are used
          to digest food. Vomiting and reflux can trigger these stomach acids to
          enter your mouth. Stomach acids are very powerful and can cause
          considerable damage to the teeth. For instance, people with bulimia or
          reflux may experience this problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another reason for this dental disease is diet. Many of the things we
          eat are acidic. Acidic foods or drinks are mostly those that taste
          very sweet. Drinks like vinegar, kombucha, sports drinks, energy
          drinks, citrus fruits, soft drinks, and many more, all cause teeth
          erosion. Additionally, regurgitation is another instrument for teeth
          erosion. Erosion from habitual regurgitation of gastric contents can
          considerably increase an acidic diet. Saliva and environmental factors
          are also contributing factors.

          Teeth erosion happens when the hard enamel surface of the teeth wears
          out, leading to sensitivity, discoloration, and other dental issues.
          Left untreated, some people end up needing root canal treatment due to

          Tooth Enamel Wear and Virtual Teeth Erosion Question Answered - Here
          are some common signs of teeth erosion:
        </h4>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Tooth or Teeth Sensitivity:</b> Perhaps the most common sign is
              a very sensitive tooth or teeth. Increased teeth sensitivity to
              hot, cold, or sweet foods and cold beverages can indicate enamel
              wear & erosion. This happens because the protective thin enamel
              layer of the tooth has worn away. This exposes and endangers the
              more sensitive tooth dentin layer underneath. The dental enamel
              wear is usually around the facial or buccal surface of teeth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Malocclusion and Changes in the Bite:</b>
              Severe erosion can affect the way your teeth fit together when you
              bite, leading to bite changes or even tooth loss in extreme cases.
              • Increased tooth decay: With enamel erosion, the protective
              barrier against bacteria and acids is compromised, thereby making
              the teeth more prone to decay and cavities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Tooth or Teeth Discoloration:</b>
              If you see signs of yellowish color around light brown color
              around where the lower part of your teeth close to the gum area
              is. The incisor teeth usually have more buccal enamel wear since
              many times people start brushing very aggressively on teeth that
              are visible when people smile. As the dental tooth enamel wears
              down & erodes, the underlying tooth dentin becomes exposed. The
              tooth dentin layer is yellowish, and becomes more noticeable and
              conspicuous. People having enamel wear will notice a light brown
              or yellow appearance around the lower part of the tooth close to
              the gums.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Difficulty eating, drinking cold drinks, and chewing food:</b>
              Teeth enamel wear can cause pain for people when drinking cold
              foods or eating sticky acidic candies. Most times people will
              avoid eating ice cream or drinking very cold drinks to avoid the
              sharp pain. Eroded enamel on teeth may make it more difficult to
              chew certain foods and to sometimes even brush your teeth in those
              areas.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Teeth seem more Transparent:</b>
              Teeth may begin to appear translucent near the edges as the enamel
              thins, giving them a glassy or see-through appearance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Flatter teeth and facial tooth surface wear: </b>
              The edges of the teeth may become more rounded or appear flattened
              due to erosion.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Tooth Enamel Chips and Cracks: </b>
              Weakened enamel is more prone to chipping or cracking, which can
              cause further erosion and dental problems.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Tooth Indentations and Tooth Cupping:</b>
              The chewing surface of the teeth may develop small, cup-like
              indentations. This is usually present around the chewing surfaces
              to teeth, as a result of dental enamel erosion.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Teeth look shorter: </b>
              Severe tooth erosion and enamel wear can make the teeth look
              shorter. This is due to the teeth being ground away due to
              clenching or perhaps when sleeping.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Tooth Brushing your teeth: </b>
              As mentioned, sometimes even brushing your teeth can be painful
              around areas with severe dental enamel wear and erosion. When the
              dentin area of your teeth is exposed, then toothache and tooth
              pain can occur when brushing your teeth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Bad breath:</b>
              Bacteria can thrive in the crevices and gaps caused by erosion,
              leading to bad breath or a foul taste in the mouth.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            If you notice any of these signs, it's important to visit your
            dentist for a comprehensive evaluation and appropriate treatment to
            prevent further damage to your teeth. Live Teledentist Consultation
            about Teeth Sensitivity may provide some useful dental information

        </h4>
        <p>
          The treatment for teeth erosion is predicated on the severity of the
          condition. Here are some common methods used to fix teeth erosion:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Fluoride treatments: </b>
              Fluoride can help demineralize the enamel and strengthen it, which
              may slow down or halt the progression of erosion. Your dentist may
              apply fluoride varnishes, gels, or foams to the teeth to help
              safeguard them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Composite and Tooth-colored fillings:</b>
              Many people with dental enamel wear will need a buccal or facial
              composite white filling. If erosion has led to cavities or tooth
              decay, tooth-colored fillings can be used to fill the cavities and
              fix the shape and operation of the teeth. These fillings are made
              of a composite resin material that aligns with the natural color
              of the teeth. Composite fillings are less costly usually than say
              dental veneers or dental crowns.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Professional dental cleanings and prophylaxis:</b>
              Regular dental cleanings can help remove plaque and tartar buildup
              from the teeth, which can contribute to erosion. Your dentist or
              dental hygienist can also provide personalized oral hygiene
              instructions to help you maintain good oral health.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Dental crowns:</b>
              In cases where erosion has caused significant damage to the teeth,
              dental crowns may be recommended. Crowns are custom-made caps that
              cover the whole tooth to protect it and restore its strength and
              appearance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Dental veneers:</b>
              Dental veneers can make your front teeth all uniform white color
              and be aesthetically pleasing. Dental Veneers are thin shells made
              of porcelain or composite resin bonded to the front or buccal
              surfaces of the teeth to improve the front of the teeth
              appearance. Dental veneers can enhance and protect the underlying
              enamel or dentin surface of teeth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Inlays and Onlays:</b>
              Inlays and onlays are like crowns, except they only cover a
              portion of the tooth surface.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Diet and lifestyle changes:</b>
              Most people will avoid eating ice cream and very cold drinks.
              Making changes to your diet and habits can help decrease erosion,
              and tooth pain and safeguard your teeth. Eating less acidic foods
              and beverages, and limit sugary snacks. Good oral hygiene is a
              key. Drinking more water, and practicing good oral hygiene habits
              such as brushing and flossing properly. Many times people do not
              brush their teeth properly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Night guard or mouthguards:</b>
              Your dentist may check for bruxism. If teeth grinding or clenching
              is contributing to erosion, your dentist may recommend wearing a
              custom night guard or mouthguard while sleeping to protect your
              teeth from more damage.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Desensitizing agents:</b>
              Desensitizing bonding material that your dentist may apply to the
              buccal or facial surface of your teeth. This provides some
              protection for the sensitive dentin layer.

          Common Live Dentistry Video Question on Reasons why teeth erode or
          have tooth enamel wear?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Tooth enamel wears down through a process called erosion, which
          involves the loss of enamel minerals due to various factors. Here are
          some common causes of enamel erosion:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Acidic Foods and Beverages:</b>
              Consuming foods and drinks high in acidity, such as citrus fruits,
              sodas, fruit juices, and vinegar-based products, can lead to
              enamel erosion. Acidic substances can soften and weaken the
              enamel, making it more susceptible to wear and damage.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Acid Reflux:</b>
              Acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can expose
              the teeth to stomach acid, which is highly corrosive and can erode
              enamel over time. The frequent regurgitation of acid into the
              mouth can significantly contribute to enamel erosion, especially
              on the back surfaces of the teeth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Bulimia:</b>
              Individuals with bulimia often engage in self-induced vomiting,
              which exposes the teeth to stomach acid. Repeated exposure to
              acidic gastric contents can lead to severe enamel erosion and
              other dental problems.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Dry Mouth or lack of saliva in the mouth:</b>
              People getting cancer treatment may have a dryer mouth. Saliva
              plays a crucial role in protecting the teeth by neutralizing acids
              and remineralizing the enamel. Chronic dry mouth, also known as
              xerostomia, reduces saliva flow, leaving the teeth more vulnerable
              to acid attacks and enamel erosion.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Abrasive Tooth Brushing:</b>
              One of the top reasons for buccal tooth surface enamel wear is
              improper tooth brushing technique. Brushing your teeth too
              vigorously or using a hard-bristled toothbrush can wear down the
              enamel over time. Abrasive toothpaste and improper brushing
              techniques can also contribute to enamel erosion.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Bruxism:</b>
              Grinding or clenching the teeth, a condition known as bruxism, can
              put excessive force on the enamel, leading to wear and erosion.
              Bruxism often occurs during sleep and may require the use of a
              nightguard to protect the teeth. Chemical Factors: Certain
              medications, such as antihistamines, antacids, and some
              prescription drugs, can have acidic or drying effects on the
              mouth, increasing the risk of enamel erosion.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Environmental Factors:</b>
              Environmental factors such as pollution, exposure to chlorinated
              swimming pool water, and industrial chemicals can also contribute
              to enamel erosion over time.
            </li>
          </ol>
          It's important to bear in mind these factors and take steps to protect
          your enamel, such as practicing good oral hygiene, limiting acidic
          foods and beverages, staying hydrated, and seeking treatment.

            A Common Live Dental Video Question we get asked is, “What is a
            composite filling?”
          </i>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Composite filling/bonding is a dental process used to repair teeth
          that are damaged due to decay, erosion, or trauma. It deals with the
          use of a tooth-colored resin material to restore the shape, function,
          and appearance of the tooth. Here's how composite filling/bonding
          works:
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Composite filling/bonding offers several advantages over traditional
          metal (amalgam) fillings, including:
          <li>
            <b>Esthetic appearance and tooth-matching colors: </b>
            Composite resin can be color-matched to the natural shade of the
            tooth to make it virtually indistinguishable from the neighboring
            teeth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Cost:</b>
            Composite fillings usually cost less than dental veneers and crowns.
            Most dental insurance companies cover most of the composite filling
            cost.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Preservation of tooth structure:</b>
            Composite fillings require less removal of healthy tooth structure
            than amalgam fillings, which helps maintain the strength and
            integrity of the tooth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Versatility:</b>
            Composite resin can be used to restore small to moderate-sized
            cavities, chips, cracks, and gaps between teeth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Reduced sensitivity to temperature changes:</b>
            Composite fillings do not conduct heat or cold as much as metal
            fillings, which can help reduce tooth sensitivity.
          </li>
