        <h3>
          The big trend toward dental telemedicine - Live Teledentist Office
          Virtual Exam and Local Teledentistry Consulting with Teledental
        </h3>
        <p>
          After COVID, many doctors and patients became familiar with virtual
          telehealth consultations. Teledental.com was one of the pioneers of
          Tele Dental Services Online. Now many people have done a live
          teledentist office examination or local teledentistry consultation
          with a licensed dentist. There are now many to start this process just
          like a dental office format. That is, the patient speaks and is first
          acquainted with the dental assistant - and then the dentist. AI
          Dentistry technology will be shaping the dental telemedicine space
          undoubtedly. AI Dental Care and AI Dental Examination of your dental
          X-rays will be happening more and more within the next decade.
        </p>
        <h3>AI Dentist and AI Dental X-ray Exam</h3>
        <p>
          AI will be changing how dental radiology and dental imaging X-rays are
          examined in the upcoming several years.
        </p>
        <h3>
          AI Virtual Dentist Consultation with an Avatar to Start - Live AI
          Dentists Exam
        </h3>
        <p>
          Many AI chat companies are now developing advanced technologies for
          patients and AI Doctors to interact. The Live AI Dentist is now coming
          into the market. Expect this type of technology to rapidly develop by
          2026. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Dentistry are the two edges of
          science that thrive together. Dentistry has evolved from primitive
          dental drills to advanced dental implants, and the process is still
          ongoing. Previously, AI was a part of science fiction or daydreams.
          Now, companies like Nvidia have become global powerhouse platforms
          pushing AI chip technology. NVDA became a $2 trillion market cap
          company - one of the largest in the world. Big technology companies
          like Google and Apple Inc. are bringing new AI technologies to the
          market.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, no one can believe this daydream has come true so early and
          infiltrated every sector. This technological revolution steps into
          every part of the medicinal world, from diagnosis to planning
          treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, let’s begin with the basics of AI Dentistry and a comprehensive
          overview of the use of artificial intelligence in dentistry!
        </p>

        <h3>What Is An AI Dentist? An Overview</h3>
        <p>
          AI is helping doctors and dentists better interact with patients. This
          trend will continue to grow as AI analytics and technology
          capabilities continue to grow. AI can help Dentists in making more
          accurate diagnoses and to better understand their patient’s dental
          issues. AI can help dental professionals with diagnosis, treatment
          planning, patient management, and other tasks. When AI analyzes
          massive amounts of data quickly and accurately, practitioners and
          patients can make timely and informed decisions. Now some are starting
          to term an AI Doctor or an AI Dentist - which can mean many things.
          The use of AI by doctors and dentists is starting to grow especially
          in radiology and other similar medical fields. We will focus on dental
          care in the local teledental AI dentist’s blog.
        </p>
        <p>
          The steps of an AI dentist in the treatment of oral health are
          outlined below
        </p>

        <h3>
          AI Dental Office Exam and Your Local Dentist Clinical Examination of
          Dental Imaging X-rays
        </h3>
        <p>
          During the dental clinical examination, your dentist will look to
          examine your jaw gums, and teeth. Your dentist will review your
          medical and dental history. With the dental exam, your dentist will
          check for indications of dental problems, and periodontal disease and
          check for any dental caries. The patient's past medical history &
          dental history are fully reviewed. For example, if a patient has
          cancer, then they may be having dry mouth problems due to any type of
          radiation treatment. and notes any current symptoms. If any dental
          abnormalities are discovered, your dentist will recommend the
          necessary dental treatment. Part of doing the dental examination is to
          fully review all the dental imaging X-rays. Radiology and
          understanding medical X-rays is an area where AI is rapidly growing.
          AI can help understand and review the data provided to it. It can help
          the dentist or doctor to notice any problems or abnormalities. For
          dentists, this can be to point our small caries and periodontal
          problems shown on the dental imaging X-rays.
        </p>
        <h3>Dental Imaging X-rays and AI Dentist Exam</h3>
        <p>
          Dental imaging is necessary for dental diagnosis. It visualizes and
          evaluates a patient's teeth, gums, jawbones, and surrounding
          structures. Below, we’ve shown you several dental imaging techniques
          that are commonly used-
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            X-rays capture the internal images of teeth and jaws. There are
            several types of dental X-rays are-
            <ul>
              <li>
                Bitewing X-rays provide images of the upper and lower back
                teeth, which are basically used for detecting cavities and
                assessing your tooth's bone density.
              </li>
              <li>
                Periapical X-rays provide an entire tooth view for diagnosing
                the root structure and surrounding bone areas.
              </li>
              <li>
                Panoramic X-rays give you a broad view of the entire mouth to
                assess temporomandibular joint (TMJ) issues and overall oral
                health.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Intraoral cameras are small, portable devices that record the
            patient's entire mouth. It can spot abnormalities in soft tissues,
            cracked teeth, and cavities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBT) is a newer type of dental
            imaging X-ray machine used many times by orthodontists or general
            dentists who will be doing orthodontic treatment on their patients.
            CBT is also used during dental implant treatment planning. CBT shows
            highly detailed images for dental implants, orthodontics, and
            assessing complex dental issues of the jaw.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Dental Image Analysis by using AI Dentistry Tools</h3>
        <p>
          Dental Image Analysis analyzes and interprets the images. This
          analysis can be performed both manually and with computer software.
          You can use dental image analysis in a variety of ways:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            For cavity detection, AI dentists highlight areas of potential decay
            that may not be visible to the naked eye.
          </li>
          <li>
            For orthodontic treatment planning, where extensive analysis is
            required, AI dentists inform orthodontists to monitor the conditions
            and make accurate planning.
          </li>
          <li>
            For dental implant procedures, where AI dentists determine the ideal
            size and position of the implant so that they can place it in the
            best possible location.
          </li>
          <li>
            For early identification of abnormal tissues, practitioners identify
            any oral diseases like oral cancers, benign tumors, or any other
            abnormal tissue patterns. Early detection reduces life-threatening
            risks.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          There’s more, but we’ll discuss this extensive topic later. Now it’s
          time to move on to the treatment planning of dental conditions.
        </p>
        <h3>Dental Treatment Planning and Virtual Teledentist Consultation</h3>
        <p>
          Treatment planning in dentistry evaluates the clinical examination and
          dental image analysis and provides the patient with appropriate dental
          care. It is a systematic process that assesses the patient's overall
          oral health and diagnoses dental issues based on the patient's needs.
          So, with care and caution, treatment planning works well with dental
          restorative procedures and even other oral surgery. Your virtual
          teledentist can provide some useful dental information about gum care
          and particular dental problems. The patient can have a better idea of
          what type of dental treatment may be necessary, after proper dental
          imaging X-rays at the dental office.
        </p>
        <h3>Dental Patient Management Information</h3>
        <p>
          Managing patients isn’t just limited to fostering doctor-patient
          relationships; it also involves assisting them with how they manage
          their health. In this case, AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants
          can give patients details on oral hygiene, post-treatment care, and
          appointment scheduling. They can also answer common questions,
          reducing the workload of dental staff.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Teledental, Virtual Dental Care, Dentistry and AI Predictive Analytics
          Tools Discussion
        </h3>
        <p>
          Predictive analytics uses data, statistical algorithms, and machine
          learning techniques to forecast future outcomes. AI provides a clearer
          view if something is missed in Image analysis or another aspect.
          Because It can study lots of patient data, finding patterns and
          trends. This helps dentists predict possible oral health problems and
          take steps to prevent them. This can help in Teledental and virtual
          dental care in the future as well. We will be discussing this further
          in upcoming Teledental articles.
        </p>
        <h3>Dental Monitoring - Monitoring and Follow-Up</h3>
        <p>
          Dentistry isn't just about treating oral issues; it's also about
          maintaining overall oral health. When a patient has a complex dental
          condition, it is necessary to monitor them on a regular basis to
          determine whether they are at risk of complications or not. Here, AI
          can track the progress of dental treatments over time and alert both
          patients and dentists about any deviations from the expected course.
        </p>
        <h3>AI Dentists Influence on Dental Conditions</h3>
        <p>
          In comparison to previous dentistry, the emergence of AI transforms
          dental medicine and redefines diagnosis, treatment, and patient care.
          It interprets and analyzes dental imaging X-rays. So dentists can
          easily detect potential issues in the mouth that they could miss out
          on sometimes. AI in dental care improves efficiency, safety, and
          accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI in dentistry simplifies X-ray analysis, enabling practitioners to
          accurately segment dental structures for monitoring the current
          condition of patients. It assesses bone density to screen for
          osteoporosis and helps in planning dental implant procedures.
          Additionally, AI assists in evaluating tooth alignment and occlusion,
          streamlining orthodontic treatment planning.
        </p>

        <p>
          Practitioners can also use AI to detect early signs of periodontal
          diseases, such as bone loss and gum recession, thereby preventing
          misdiagnosis and improving patient outcomes. AI algorithms leverage
          extensive datasets of dental X-ray images encompassing various dental
          conditions, including cavities, fractures, infections, and impacted
          teeth. These algorithms also pioneer anomaly detection for future
          advancements in dental diagnostics.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI for dentistry won’t stop there; it can be trained to identify
          various dental conditions and abnormalities in X-ray images. Here's
          how the process generally works:
        </p>

        <p>
          Firstly, you need to gather diverse dental X-ray image data covering
          various conditions for AI training. The more you collect data, the
          more you learn about dental diagnostic accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, dental experts label images, mark anomalies' locations,
          and spot patterns in X-rays. It identifies abnormal features like
          density, shape, and texture, and its algorithm minimizes errors.
          However, for continuous improvement, AI must be updated on a regular
          basis with new data, and so must the practitioners.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember, AI can help, but human expertise is required for treatment
          decisions.
        </p>
