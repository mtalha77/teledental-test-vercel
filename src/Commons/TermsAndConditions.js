          Welcome to Teledental. We try our best to provide good dental
          information for people seeking dental feedback or suggestions. Our
          goal is to provide good dental information that will hopefully provide
          useful dental suggestions for individuals. All people using our site
          (we will repeat this several times) will need to use good common sense
          and do their own due diligence. We do Not guarantee any dental results
          and Do Not guarantee that all dental information will be useful or
          accurate. Each dentist has their own view of what is the best course
          of action or the best dental treatment plan for any given patient. We
          believe Teledental is the future of dentistry. As technology gets
          better, we will be able to provide even more features. With any online
          site, there can always be errors or mistakes done. Hence, any dental
          information or suggestion should be used only as a suggestion. Our
          goal is to help people get better dental information.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>
            We provide only dental suggestions and recommend all our users to
            seek a full dental exam and dental imaging x-rays at a local dental
            office to get a more clear and better understanding of the type of
            dental care treatment they require. Furthermore, any dentist or
            dental office referred to - you as a patient need to do your own due
            diligence. Any dental treatment received needs to approved by you
            and the dental office. Teledental has nothing to do with any kind of
            dental treatment or dental service. Hence, Teledental is not liable
            in any way for any dental service, costs or dental treatment
            provided at any dental office. Like any search engine, we have only
            done an introduction to the dental business - and hope that both
            parties are able to mutually benefit.

            I understand that my health care provider wishes me to engage in a
            telemedicine consultation. 2. My health care provider has explained
            to me how the video conferencing technology will be used to affect
            such a consultation will not be the same as a direct patient/health
            care provider visit due to the fact that I will not be in the same
            room as my health care provider. 3. I understand there are potential
            risks to this technology, including interruptions, unauthorized
            access, and technical difficulties. I understand that my health care
            provider or I can discontinue the telemedicine consult/visit if it
            is felt that the videoconferencing connections are not adequate for
            the situation. 4. I understand that my healthcare information may be
            shared with other individuals for scheduling and billing purposes.
            Others may also be present during the consultation other than my
            health care provider and consulting health care provider in order to
            operate the video equipment. The above-mentioned people will all
            maintain the confidentiality of the information obtained. I further
            understand that I will be informed of their presence in the
            consultation and thus will have the right to request the following:
            (1) omit specific details of my medical history/physical examination
            that are personally sensitive to me; (2) ask non-medical personnel
            to leave the telemedicine examination room: and or (3) terminate the
            consultation at any time. 5. I have had the alternatives to a
            telemedicine consultation explained to me, and in choosing to
            participate in a telemedicine consultation. I understand that some
            parts of the exam involving physical tests may be conducted by
            individuals at my location at the direction of the consulting health
            care provider. 6. In an emergent consultation, I understand that the
            responsibility of the telemedicine consulting specialist is to
            advise my local practitioner and that the specialist’s
            responsibility will conclude upon the termination of the video
            conference connection. 7. I understand that billing will occur from
            both my practitioner and as a facility fee from the site from which
            I am presented. 8. I have had a direct conversation with my doctor,
            during which I had the opportunity to ask questions in regard to
            this procedure. My questions have been answered and the risks,
            benefits and any practical alternatives have been discussed with me
            in a language in which they understand.

          <p>EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES:</p>
          <p>
            Our goal is to have the utmost privacy on our site. Furthermore, we
            do allow our users to use just a last name initial - instead of a
            full last name ... so as to allow some personal privacy and
            anonymity. Like all sites, there are many users and people
            administering our website and app. Those people who wish to have
            100% privacy in a closed setting such as a doctor's office, should
            NOT use our online services. Anytime searching online, using an app
            or other online services - there usually is some form of personal
            information that others may unintentionally see. All people using
            our site, we do not force to use or know actual identity of the
            person - that is using our site. Many people using our site use a
            nickname or alias when asking a general question? People use various
            profile names, abbreviations, or possible nicknames. Hence, with our
            chat admin - the names on there may or may not be accurate? We do at
            times do live demo of our site for dentists, professionals, and
            those wanting to work with us. Hence, all those that absolutely want
            to be anonymous - can use a nickname. Furthermore, we do not ask for
            a complete address of individuals. We ask for the city and state -
            again, this may or may not be accurate? We will answer people's
            questions from all over and do not need accurate personal
            information as far as the person's identity of the location of the
            person. The exception to this is if someone - is if a person is
            seeking a dentist in their area. Also, if a person is seeking
            antibiotics and medications - then the person needs to provide
            accurate information to us. Then the general chatbot area is where
            we may use demo of our site. If do not want to share your identity,
            you can provide an alias name there. We do try our best to keep your
            personal information as private as possible. Our policy is to not
            share an individual's personal information with other companies,
            which is shared with people's emails. We do use images shared to us
            of teeth or portions of the face, for promotional purposes. We do
            NOT put an individual's name next to it. We try not to put a full

          Teledental makes reasonable efforts to ensure that Healthcare
          Providers only participate in the Services if they hold all active
          licenses required by law to practice the specialties of the services
          offered by them, and are not excluded from participation in the
          Medicare and Medicaid programs. Teledental may exclude Healthcare
          Providers who, in Teledental discretion, have engaged in inappropriate
          or unprofessional conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some Healthcare Providers listed through the Services enter into
          contracts with us, and may pay us a fee in order to be marketed
          through the Services. To help you find Healthcare Providers who may be
          suitable for your needs, and enable the maximum choice and diversity
          of Healthcare Providers participating in the Services, we will provide
          you with lists and/or profiles of Healthcare Providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          These results are based on information that you provide to us, such as
          insurance information, geographical location, and healthcare
          specialty. They may also be based on other criteria (including, for
          example, Healthcare Provider availability, past selections by and/or
          ratings of Healthcare Providers by you or by other Teledental users,
          and past experience of Teledental users with Healthcare Providers).
          Note that Teledental (a) does not recommend or endorse any Healthcare
          Providers, (b) does not make any representations or warranties with
          respect to these Healthcare Providers or the quality of the healthcare
          services they may provide, and (c) does not receive any additional
          fees from Healthcare Providers for featuring them (i.e., higher or
          better placement on lists) through the Services (subject to Sponsored
          Results as described below). Note, however, to the extent that you use
          the Services as provided by your employer, Teledental may provide

          Information (as defined below) you provide to us as well as Healthcare

            Teledental is NOT RESPONSIBLE for any dental expense or any medical
            expense. Teledental will Not Pay for any dental service provided to
            any individual.

          That is, Teledental will not reimburse or pay any dental practice fee.{" "}
          <u>
            Any users referred to any dental practice are expected to do their
            own due diligence.{" "}
          </u>{" "}
          Usual, customary and any other charges for any dental, medical or
          related services rendered by Healthcare Providers will apply and will
          be entirely your responsibility. You must resolve any dispute between
          you or any Healthcare Provider arising from any transaction hereunder
          directly with the Healthcare Provider. We do NOT GUARANTEE ANY DENTAL
          SERVICES provided by any dentist we refer to or do not refer to. We
          expect all individuals to maintain their own dental care, their own
          good oral hygiene and to find the best local dentists that will
          provide the treatment they desire. Hence, all individuals using
          Teledental are responsible for their own dental decisions. Teledental
          is providing feedback that may or may not be accurate. Teledental does
          not do a full oral exam, does not take dental x-rays and does not know
          the full medical history of people that come onto our site. Hence, we
          can ONLY PROVIDE A DENTAL SUGGESTION that may or may not be right. Our
          goal is to provide good dental information, though dentists have
          different opinions on what is the best dental treatment. For example,
          holistic dentists may consider getting a porcelain dental crown as not
          being a good idea. While most dentists would differ in that opinion.
