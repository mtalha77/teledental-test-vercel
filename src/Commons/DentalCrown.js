        <p>
          If you are undergoing a problem of having a damaged tooth that either
          causes pain or a bad embarrassing appearance, your dentist might
          suggest fixing your tooth with various treatment options, with getting
          a dental crown being one of them. Modern dental crowns have been
          around for the last 100 years plus in various forms, with Dr Land
          being credited with the first porcelain crown in which he patented in
          1889. Most dentists 60 or 70 years ago, would prefer dental gold
          crowns - due to the longevity and the fact that the gold would be more
          malleable - which made it easier to chew on. Of course, now - most
          crowns are white to match the color of the teeth, and are usually made
          of some kind of modern porcelain or zirconia material.
        </p>
        <p>
          People do use local teledentists for dental crown information and or a
          virtual dental crown teledental consultation. They can be asking about
          a large filling that may be breaking down or an old dental crown, that
          they may want to replace. Your local teledentist can provide some
          dental crown suggestions - such as potential costs and an overall
          overview.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the local teledental crown virtual consultation - your dentist
          will most likely schedule a time for you as the patient to come in and
          get a full in-office dental exam & dental x-rays. The virtual dental
          crown teledentistry consultation can help to prepare the patient of
          potential costs and a treatment plan time table. Since many times, a
          dental crown will need more than one dental visit to complete.

            <u>
              Teledental dental crown question information - What is a dental
              crown?
            </u>
          </h3>
        </p>
        <p>
          Simply, it is a covering restoration “caps” that restores, protects,
          and improves your tooth appearance. It can be made from metals,
          porcelain, resin, metal porcelain combination, and ceramics. Many
          times during a local teledental crown consultation, people will ask
          the dental crown question - what is a dental crown? Many times people
          mistake a dental crown with a dental composite filling. A composite
          filling - is just that. A filling placed into the tooth after the
          removal of tooth decay. A dental crown requires tooth preparation, a
          dental impression and then the cementing of the dental crown that goes
          on the tooth.
        </p>
        <h3>Why Would I Need A Dental Crown?</h3>
        <p>
          A dental crown is a quite common dental restoration when you have one
          of the following situations
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A severely worn-down tooth structure due to decay.</li>
          <li>A deterioration of a previously placed restoration.</li>
          <li>A fractured tooth due to trauma.</li>
          <li>
            A tooth that has undergone a root canal (especially posterior
            teeth).
          </li>
          <li>A missing tooth.</li>
          <li>Need a cover to an implant.</li>
          <li>
            Aesthetics need to achieve a more beautiful smile by modifying the
            teeth size, shape, color, and alignment.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Crown Prep Procedures</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            During the dental visit, your dentist will talk to you about
            different treatment options that you could have, other treatment
            options may include filling, teeth whitening, orthodontic treatment,
            removable restorations, or dental implants.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you decide to get a crown, your dentist will prepare the
            damaged tooth to make room for the crown to fit comfortably.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then he will take an impression for the crown by using an impression
            paste placed on your trimmed tooth or by scanning your teeth with an
            intraoral scanner. This is achieved by two ways:
          </li>
          <ul style={{ listStyle: "decimal" }}>
            <li>
              <strong>The multi-day procedure with a temporary crown</strong>{" "}
              means you dentist inserts a temporary crown until your permanent
              crown returns from the dental lab.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Same-day crown installation</strong> means you will not
              need a temporary crown. Your crown will be ready in a single
              visit. For this purpose, some dental offices offer using one of
              several methods involving computer aided design/computer-aided
              manufacturing (CAD/CAM). Same day teledental crown consulting can
              be useful - ahead of time. Since, usually when doing in the dental
              office the entire procedure in one session - it may take a longer
              dental time session.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Finally, when your crown is finished your dentist will replace the
            temporary crown (if exists) with the permanent one, then cementing
            it to your tooth, checking your occlusion, and verifying your
            comfort and satisfaction.
          </li>
          <li>
            After you get a crown, your tooth may feel sensitive for just a few
            days while it adjusts to the new situation. During this time, you
            will need to avoid extremely hot or cold foods. It is recommended to
            not chew on your crown for a few days while the cement sets
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Types of Dental Crowns</h3>
        <p>Different crown materials can be used are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Metals as gold crowns, some dentists may suggest a gold crown as the
            preferred option for back teeth. As they are strong and highly
            resistant. However, gold crowns do not make an extremely popular
            choice today due to their color and aesthetics.
          </li>
          <li>
            Porcelain is the most popular type of crown used nowadays. They are
            entirely made of porcelain material. They match your surrounding
            teeth in all parameters, shape, size, and color. Porcelain crowns
            can last a long time and long as it has been taken care of.
          </li>
          <li>
            a combination of materials as in porcelain fused to metal crowns
            (PFM). This type of combination provides both strength due to their
            metal structure and aesthetics due to the porcelain coat that covers
            the cap.
          </li>
          <li>
            Zirconia Crowns is a relatively new material. It has the strength of
            metal with the aesthetics of porcelain. Their process is less
            time-consuming with minimal tooth preparation.
          </li>
          <li>
            E- MAX: Lithium Disilicate Crowns: The newest type of crown in
            dentistry today. Providing great aesthetics and strength. However,
            they are more expensive.

          <u>Tele Dental Veneer Information - What is a Dental Veneer?</u>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The word veneer means a thin decorative covering, which means not all
          the tooth surfaces are covered with the restoration as in crowns. It
          works by adding a covering to an existing tooth from outside to
          improve its appearance or function.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What is the difference between a tooth veneer and a tooth crown?
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>A veneer</strong> is a very thin layer of porcelain or other
            materials, about 1 millimeter (mm) in thickness, that replace the
            top layer of enamel, bonded to your existing tooth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>A crown</strong> covers the entire tooth. It is double the
            thickness of a veneer, making it more durable and resistant to
            cracking than a veneer
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          <u>Dental Veneer Teledentistry Consulting</u> - Dental Veneers are a
          good solution in certain cases like:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Discolored teeth when bleaching is not an effective solution.</li>
          <li>
            Chipped, cracked, or broken teeth when no need to full crown
            coverage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Minor shape corrections as in slightly malformed or tilted teeth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Teeth spacing and diastema. It is good to get a general idea of the
            dental costs and an overview of the dental veneers treatment
            procedure during a local teledentist dental veneer consultation
            online. This can provide some useful information ahead of time and
            prepare the patient for the procedure & costs. Dental Veneers are
            usually done in pairs - 2 teeth or 4 teeth or 6 teeth etc. Each
            tooth can cost anywhere from $750 to $1500 per tooth, though prices
            in the USA can vary from state to state - and from dental office to
            office.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          Teledentistry Dental Inlay Service - What are Dental Inlays and Dental
          Onlays?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Both inlay and onlay are restorations that have been constructed out
          of the mouth then cemented into the prepared tooth cavity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What is an Inlay?</strong> inlays go inside cavities of the
          tooth after tooth preparation. The dental inlay requires a dental
          impression and usually will cost more than a tooth filling. Doing a
          local teledental inlay consultation can provide good dental
          information about the dental inlay procedure and the costs involved
          for the patient ahead of the dental office visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What is Dental Onlays?</strong> onlays usually go on top of a
          tooth cusp to replace a bit of it and the adjoining surface of the
          tooth. And onlays repair larger areas.
          <br />
          Broth are conservative and custom-made dental restorations. They are
          made on the posterior teeth that have a mild or moderate amount of
          decay.
          <br />
          They are made from gold, porcelain, or other metals. Recently,
          porcelain and composite resin are the preferred choice by patients
          because they are more cosmetically pleasing than gold.
        </p>
        <h3>What is the Difference Between Dental Crown and Bridge?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Dental Crowns</strong> covers an existing tooth while a bridge
          is used when you need to replace one missing tooth or more.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <u>
            Dental Bridge Teledentistry Consulting - Dental Bridge Teledental
            Information
          </u>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Dental Bridge</strong> has two crowns – one on either end –
          and a dummy (false tooth called a pontic) in the middle. For all 3
          teeth regions, your dentist will most likely charge you for it. Hence,
          for a missing tooth - a 3 unit bridge may cost 3 times a dental crown.
          So, if a single crown costs $1000 - then a 3 unit bridge may cost
          $3000. Nowadays, more people are choosing to place a single dental
          implant in the missing tooth region. Still, many people do get dental
          bridges spanning 3 or 4 or 5 teeth in many areas of the world. It is
          important to maintain good oral hygiene. People do seek local
          teledental dental bridge consultations to better understand the dental
          bridge treatment plan and the costs involved - since it can be fairly
          costly.
        </p>
        <h3>I Have a Crowned Tooth, does it Need Special Care?</h3>
        <p>
          If you are following good oral hygiene practices, then your crowned
          tooth will not need any additional care. Except that the underlying
          tooth still needs to be protected from decay or gum disease. So keep
          brushing your teeth twice a day and flossing once a day where the gum
          meets your tooth. Also, avoid biting on hard surfaces with porcelain
          crowns to prevent cracking the porcelain. Having regular dental exams
          and dental prophy cleanings is a good idea to make sure your dental
          crown is in good condition.
